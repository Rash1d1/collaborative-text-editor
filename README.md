### ðŸ“‚ Branch Purpose

This branch serves as the central repository for configuration files used by the Collaborative Text Editor project on the remote server. Key configurations include:

- **Docker Compose (`compose.yaml`)**: Orchestrates the application and monitoring services (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Loki).  
- **Prometheus Configuration (`prometheus.yml`)**: Defines scrape targets for metrics collection.  
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Pre-configured dashboards for visualizing application and server metrics.  

These files are deployed to `/root/project` on the remote server (`217.19.4.30`) to maintain consistency across deployments.

### ðŸš€ Deployment Workflow

On every push to this branch, a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered to automate the deployment of configuration files to the remote server. The workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Checkout Code**: Clones the latest version of this branch.  
2. **Copy Files via SSH**: Uses `appleboy/ssh-action` to securely copy updated configuration files to `/root/project` on `217.19.4.30`.  
   - SSH credentials are securely stored in GitHub Secrets (`SSH_HOST`, `SSH_USERNAME`, `SSH_KEY`).  
3. **Restart Services**: Restarts affected services (e.g., via `docker-compose up -d`) to apply the new configurations without downtime.  

This automation ensures that configuration updates are seamlessly applied to the production environment, maintaining the applicationâ€™s stability and monitoring capabilities.
